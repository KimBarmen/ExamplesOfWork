# What is this?

This repo contains multiple projects, to showcase some of the technologies I have worked on. All of the code is written exclusively by me, from the ground up.

## ElectronBoilerplate - C# multiplatform ui

This project is to create a simple starting point for an electron-based C# application. 
It uses razor for html generation, with a model-view-controller approach for ui-object handling and callback. 

## InterThreadComunications - Python multithreading
This application demonstrates a pultiprocess approach to event-handling, so that an app can run on multiple cores concurrently. In this example, data is transferred between an UI thread and an worker thread using a thread-safe queue

## MicroDbServer - Python lightweight db server

This is database-and-server is implemented in a single file, and can run on any python runtime. It produces a document-based database that is fulle persistent and is reachable on the local netwok (Or external, if you are *that* insane). It has support for tables and queries through POST and PUT request. 

## NuralNetInCSharp - Fully granular machine learning in C#
 This (rather lage) example showcases a full implementation of a neural net, for machine learning and prediction. It is not especially fast, but is instead fully customisable, and can be tailored to any use-case where pre-made libraries and frameworks are too rigid. 

## XorEncrypt - Encryption using xor operations
This little program contains functionality to apply bitwise xor operations directly to whole files, and optionally with a encryption-grade random block. No sane person will ever need this level of mathematical-unbreakable encryption, but here it is anyway.
